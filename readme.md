# Mini ZK-SNARK From Scratch

This project is only a small educational demo.
It shows the basic ideas: R1CS, QAP, EC pairings, but it is not a real or secure zk-SNARK.

To make it a real zk-SNARK: 
- Build the full QAP and compute H(t)
- Generate a complete CRS
- Implement Groth16

Python Standard Library Only

## Not securized

For learning/demonstration

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
